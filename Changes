mnm (0.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated packaging so that I can build a perl dist when I build
    the debian dist.

mnm (0.01-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added full long options and pod support of -h, --help and --man.

  * Added a column to the record format to support portforwarded
    ssh connections. The column may be "STD" to imply the normal
    tcp22 connection or else a tcp port number, like 2222.

  * Since this changes the mnm input file format, the old 5 column
    record format has been grandfathered and will still work but
    is not documented and gets a warning printed for every line
    of that sort processed.

  * Error message added for case where there are too few columns
    in a record; if there are too many the extra ones are, for the
    moment, ignored.

  * Added --test switch to make it easy to test mnm data files without
    it actually modifying the file system. This sets the rsync
    -n option on all rsync calls.

  * rsync will always use --partial so that partially transferred
    files will be reused if you kill a transfer and restart. This
    is very useful since I sometimes transfer multi-gigabyte file
    system images which makes complete restarts an uninviting
    proposition.

mnm (0.01-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dropped use of system(a,b,c) for calling rsync because there were 
    just too many problems with interpretations of args. I solved
    those problems by constructing the whole string and using the
    system(a) form. The problem with embedded metachars like 'Air&Space'
    is solved by requiring they be properly quoted in the input
    file, 'Air\&Space' for example.
    This release also fixes a serious bug in setting the id string.
    I used the wrong variable for the conditional.
