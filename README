This directory is set up for 3 way use. Mostly you have to be
root to do anything useful in this sort of development

1) It is a debian native source directory. You can generate 
a new debian package by doing:

	cd example-1.00
        dpkg-buildpackage -rsudo -k<keysig> -pgpg

The end result is a new .deb package of the same name as this directory.
That is why the directory is in the standard debian format.

2) THIS PART IS NOT APPLICABLE TO NON-LIBRARY OBJECTS AT THIS TIME.

Each of the major subdirectories is a separately updateable cvs 
repository. Thus other people can work on parts of the system 
rather than the whole one. So you use the usual cvs commands 
to sync with the repository, for example:

	cd Example/lib
	cvs update

Or to commit your own changes to the repository, for example:

	cd Example/lib
	cvs commit

3) Each of the perl module subdirectories is a standard CPAN
style perl source module. You can install just that module
locally by doing the usual CPAN commands:

	cd Example
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

So keep this in mind on anything you do. It's convenient to be
able to do all of these things.
